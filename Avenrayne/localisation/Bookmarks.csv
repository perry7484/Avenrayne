BM_GREAT_SHIFTING_INFO;As the years of Capraccian dominance fade into memory, the new realms struggle to maintain stability, with but one strong Empire in the west, the shattered Christian realms fighting ceaselessly amongst themselves. To the north, several newly-unified Pagan realms look hungrily to their southern neighbors, whilst in Aluqiyya, the rulers of a new faith look to bring their faith to the fighting Christians - by force if necessary. And at the center of it all, the once-great Capraccia holds on to but a few key strongholds, and looks mournfully at its former capital, now the holy seat of the Occidental church. In this new era, a great shifting is afoot - one that will shake the continent to its core, and begin to shape a new future for its people.;The Great Shifting;The Great Shifting;;The Great Shifting;;;;;;;;;x
